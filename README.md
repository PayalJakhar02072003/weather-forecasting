# Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a **Weather Forecasting System** using machine learning techniques. The system processes weather-related data, applies machine learning models, and predicts future weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and other relevant parameters.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of raw weather datasets.  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
- Implementation of machine learning models for weather prediction.  
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy metrics.  
- Easy-to-use and reproducible Jupyter Notebook.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses weather datasets (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) to train and test the model.  
- Data includes **historical weather records**.  
- Features include: temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, etc.  
- Dataset source: Publicly available weather datasets (can be replaced with your own).
